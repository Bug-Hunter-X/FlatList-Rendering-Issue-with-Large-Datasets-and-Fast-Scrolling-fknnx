The solution involves using the `getItemLayout` prop of the FlatList component.  This prop allows you to provide the dimensions of each item in the list, which significantly improves the rendering performance, especially with large datasets and fast scrolling.  Here's how you can modify your FlatList:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
    offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
    index,
  })}
/>
```

Where `ITEM_HEIGHT` is a constant representing the height of each item in your list.  By pre-calculating the dimensions, the FlatList can optimize its rendering and avoid the blank spaces or incorrect data issues.
